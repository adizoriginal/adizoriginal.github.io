    <h1>👨‍💻 AbdulHaseeb Umar</h1>
    <p>I'm a passionate full stack developer and an enthusiast of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning with a sharp eye for solving real-world problems through tech. Currently completing dual Computer Science degrees at the University of Debrecen and University of the People, I've built intelligent systems ranging from emotion-detecting Android apps to full-stack AI-powered nutrition platforms. With several technical certifications in areas like machine learning, cybersecurity, and data science, I thrive on crafting secure and purposeful applications using technologies like Java, React, Python, and C#. I'm always learning, always building, and open to internship or full-time roles across computer science domains—including full-stack web development, software engineering, web design, AI & data solutions, secure systems, productivity tools, and technical support—where I can apply my diverse academic background, project experience, and certifications to create meaningful impact while growing with the organization.</p>
